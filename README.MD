## Postgres Schema based Multitenancy

This is a simple app that demonstrates multitenancy using PostgreSQL's Schemas. 
Its supposed to be a incredibly simple ERP ;) :D

### Bonus

This app also has an illustration of how Postgres' HStore can be used to have dynamic fields which
is useful while doing ERP, CRM like applications.
